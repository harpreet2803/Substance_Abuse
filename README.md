# Substance_Abuse

Substance abuse, a pervasive public health concern, continues to challenge societies worldwide, with the misuse of marijuana standing as a prominent facet of this complex issue. According to SAMHSA results of 2022[16], 59.8 percent (or 168.7 million people) used tobacco, vaped nicotine, used alcohol, or used an illicit drug in the past month; 48.7 percent (or 137.4 million people) drank alcohol in the past month; 18.1 percent (or 50.9 million people) used a tobacco product in the past month; 8.3 percent (or 23.5 million people) vaped nicotine in the past month; and 16.5 percent (or 46.6 million people) used an illicit drug in the past month.

The main vision of the project is the early detection of substance abuse based on machine learning data trends. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) provides a wealth of valuable data that can serve as a foundation for a comprehensive analysis of substance abuse trends. This research is motivated by a gap in the existing literature, which lacks a comprehensive focus on predictive modelling for substance abuse. By leveraging the vast and intricate dataset provided by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), this study endeavors to answer the question: “Can machine learning help communities address the issue of substance abuse?” This question can be addressed by achieving the following goals :\\
-> Predictive modeling for early detection
-> Identifying key predictors of substance abuse and relationship between them
-> Examining patterns across demographics, health conditions, lifestyle behaviors and familial conditions
-> Fostering collaboration between domain experts and machine learning practitioners
-> Machine learning interpretability prioritized as a critical task with focus on misclassifications
